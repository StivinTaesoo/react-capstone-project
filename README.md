# Patient Data Management System

A modern, frontend-only Single Page Application (SPA) for managing patients, staff and drugs — built with React + TypeScript and using `localStorage` to simulate backend behavior.

## 🎯 Overview

This project is a frontend simulation of a Patient Data Management System. It demonstrates typical features you'd expect in a small healthcare admin app:

-   Multi-section navigation (Patients, Staff, Drugs)
-   User authentication (signup/login) with client-side hashing
-   CRUD operations for patients, staff and drugs
-   Local persistent storage via `localStorage`
-   Mobile-responsive UI with a navigation bar and footer
-   Loading indicators and simulated async behavior

This project was built as a capstone / demo and intentionally keeps all logic client-side for simplicity.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication

-   Sign up (password hashed via SHA-256 in the browser)
-   Login with credential verification against a local user store
-   Session persisted in `localStorage`
-   Protected routes (Patients, Staff, Drugs) using React Router

### 🗂 Multi-section Management

-   Patients: create, view, edit, delete. Each patient has appointments, diagnoses, prescriptions, adherence and future appointments.
-   Staff: manage staff profiles and roles.
-   Drugs: manage drug inventory, including stock and manufacturer.

### 🔎 Search

-   Search patients by name or ID.
-   Search for drugs and staff (search inputs scaffolded for expansion).

### 🧭 Navigation & Layout

-   Responsive NavBar (hamburger on mobile)
-   Home page with quick action cards
-   Footer with basic project info

### ⚡ UX

-   Loading indicators for async actions
-   Confirmation dialogs on destructive actions
-   Accessible forms with `label` + `id` pairs

## 🛠 Technology Stack

-   React 18
-   TypeScript 5
-   React Router v6
-   CSS (modular, responsive)
-   LocalStorage (to simulate server persistence)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js v14+
-   npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StivinTaesoo/react-capstone-project.git
cd react-capstone-project
```

2. **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn run dev
    ```

4. **Open your browser**
    ```
    Navigate to http://localhost:3000 OR http://localhost:5173
    ```

### First-Time Setup

1. **Create an account**

    - Click "Sign up here" on the login page
    - Enter a unique username
    - Create a strong password
    - Click "Sign Up"

2. **Login**
    - Enter your credentials
    - System automatically fetches initial patient data
    - You'll be redirected to the patient list

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Current Implementation

⚠️ **Important**: This is a demonstration application with simplified security.

-   **Password Encryption**: Uses Base64 encoding (NOT production-ready)
-   **Session Management**: Simple localStorage tokens
-   **No Backend**: All data stored client-side
-   **No HTTPS**: Relies on browser security

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility

### Supported Browsers

-   ✅ Chrome (v90+)
-   ✅ Firefox (v88+)
-   ✅ Safari (v14+)
-   ✅ Edge (v90+)

### Required Features

-   localStorage API
-   Fetch API
-   ES6+ JavaScript
-   CSS Grid & Flexbox

### Testing

Test the application in different browsers:

```bash
# Chrome
npm run dev


```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

-   Add server API (Node/Express) with secure auth
-   Replace simple hashing with bcrypt on the server and use secure cookies/JWT
-   Improve search with debouncing & filters
-   Add real-time updates via WebSockets
-   Add role-based access control & permissions
-   Add pagination and advanced sorting for lists
